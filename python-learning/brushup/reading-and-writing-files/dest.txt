Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are technologies which allow web
browsers and web servers to communicate over a secured connection. This means that the data being sent is encrypted
by one side, transmitted, then decrypted by the other side before processing. This is a two-way process, meaning that
both the server AND the browser encrypt all traffic before sending out data.

Another important aspect of the SSL/TLS protocol is Authentication. This means that during your initial attempt to
communicate with a web server over a secure connection, that server will present your web browser with a set of
credentials, in the form of a "Certificate", as proof the site is who and what it claims to be. In certain cases,
the server may also request a Certificate from your web browser, asking for proof that you are who you claim to be.
This is known as "Client Authentication," although in practice this is used more for business-to-business (B2B)
 transactions than with individual users. Most SSL-enabled web servers do not request Client Authentication.
