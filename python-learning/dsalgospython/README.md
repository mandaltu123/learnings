This will be learning data structures and algorithms in python.

Data structures:
    
    arrays
    linked lists
    stacks 
    queues
    binary search trees
    balanced binary trees
    heaps 
    dictionaries
    tries
    
Graph algorithms:

    graph traversal algorithms BFS and DFS 
    shortest path algorithms 
    spanning trees
    
Sorting algorithms 

    bubble sort
    selection sort 
    quick sort
    merge sort
